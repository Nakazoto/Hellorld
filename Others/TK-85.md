NEC TK-80/TK-85
---------------

The NEC [TK-80] is a trainer board using the NEC μCOM-80 (μPD8080A), a CPU
that was (mostly) compatible with the Intel 8080A. Released in 1976, it was
one of the first microprocessor systems easily available to the public in
Japan and, though developed for engineers considering using the μCOM-80 in
their products, became immensely popular with hobbyists who could afford
neither more expensive systems nor the terminals that they usually
required. The TK-85, released in 1980, was essentially the same but with an
8085-compatible μPD8085AC processor.
